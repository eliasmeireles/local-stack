## LocalStack Setup for Development

This project uses **LocalStack** to emulate AWS services locally, allowing for development and testing without needing access to live AWS resources.

### Key Components

- **LocalStack**: A fully functional local AWS cloud stack. This allows emulation of a wide range of AWS services on your local machine.
- **Multipass**: Used to create and manage virtual instances to run LocalStack in an isolated environment.
- **awscli-local**: The `awslocal` command is a wrapper for the AWS CLI to interact with LocalStack services.

### How to Use

1. **Set up LocalStack instance**: 
   - The provided script will set up a LocalStack instance on a Multipass virtual machine.
   - It configures necessary services such as SQS, DynamoDB, and more, all running locally.

2. **Persistent Data**: 
   - Data generated by LocalStack (e.g., queues, tables) is stored in a specified directory on your host system, ensuring persistence across container restarts.

3. **AWS CLI Integration**: 
   - Use `aws` or `awslocal` to interact with LocalStack, just like you would with the real AWS environment.
   - Example command to create an SQS queue:

     ```bash
     awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
     ```

4. **Automatic Docker and Python Setup**:
   - The setup script automatically installs Docker and Python dependencies for LocalStack in the instance.
   - It also ensures Docker permissions are correctly set up for the `ubuntu` user to run Docker commands.

### Prerequisites

- **Multipass**: Required to launch virtual machines.

### Benefits

- **Local development environment**: No need for AWS credentials or an internet connection to test AWS services.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that your development and testing environments are consistent with the actual AWS infrastructure.
- **Cost-effective**: Develop and test against AWS services without incurring costs on your AWS account.
